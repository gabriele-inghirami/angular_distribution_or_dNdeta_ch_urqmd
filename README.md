# angular_distribution_urqmd

Python script to compute the angular distribution probability of baryons and mesons
originating in the first string or elastic interaction in pp collisions simulated
with UrQMD.

This mini repository also contains:
- gnuplot_scripts : to plot the results
- urmqd_inputfiles : prototypes of UrQMD inputfiles to run the simulations to create the data
